# PF-final-project
## This project is a airport flight management terminal. 

## project proposal:
<p>the idea was to create a program that can cater to the needs of both management staff and the<br>
   people coming to the airport. A layer of security is to be added to ensure a normal user cant access<br>
   the admin panel and the data in the file cant be manually changed. In addition to that data recycling functionality<br>
   was to be added so that any and all flight records deleted are stored in another recycled file and that data could be<br>
   deleted later on. Attractive prompt messages to be displayed to make the interface more user friendly and should have<br>
   enough data manipulation options for the management.
</p>

## It has 2 main sections:

### admin panel:
1. uses a password to login to admin panel
2. can add flights and their information to a binary file
3. can view a list of all available flights from a binary file
4. can search for specific flights using their flight number
5. can edit specific information for flights that have already been saved to the file
6. can delete a flights data from the file
7. exit the program with a prompt message

### user panel:
1. can search for information on arriving flights
2. can search for information on departing flights
3. A self check in system that uses a criteria for the passport numbers and ticket numbers to inform the passengers on if their flights are in business class <br> or in economy class and services offered by both are mentioned
4. passengers can choose their connecting flights and calculate how long will it take to reach their destination through these different routes
